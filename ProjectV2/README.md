# Improved schematic and PCB layout
Second version of the project, done after the official conclusion of the report.

MAIN CHANGES:
Changed MCU to Arduino Nano, which is smaller; added power reverse polarity protection; added DAC of 10 bits that will communicate through I2C with the Arduino Nano; added copper area to the PCB, something that was not done on the previous iteration of the project; added bypass capacitors close to the amplifiers and another components that may require stable voltage; new PCB design with improved location of the components; smaller size of the PCB; added LED signals to verify digital pins states; removed MAX485 module and built my own in-board; removed Zener diodes in the voltage divider since it was messing with the measurement (probably due to leakage current).

NOTE: Arduino Nano code will be updated as soon as the DAC code is sucessfully tried and tested with the arrival of the PCB and respective montage, since there was no Î¼MAX to DIP adapter to test the DAC before implementation.
